Here is the full text copied in case it isn't showing up there or something:

For today's lab in our open source software class, we are required to write a blog post about a current topic in the open source software world. Recently, Richard Stallman has announced his return to the Free Software Foundation, prompting backlash due to his history of controversial statements and toxic behavior. This seems reminiscent of complaints about Linus Torvalds. The question is, does this behavior belong in these communities? I think some of that aggression is fine, but only when directed towards ideas, not people. If the Linux kernel were to accept contributions that were even a little substandard, then that would overtime degrade its quality. Having someone willing to stubbornly put their foot down to maintain the ideals of a project is a good thing. That said, when the criticism drifts towards people attempting to make contributions, all that does is drive people away. These people could have provided quality input later down the line, but if they are driven away because they understandably do not want to put up with a slew of insults hurled their way, then their input is lost. I think the distinction of person vs. idea that the person came up with is an important one for these communities to keep in mind.
