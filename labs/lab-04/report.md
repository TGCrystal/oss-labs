### Question 1
https://github.com/TGCrystal/oss-labs/blob/master/LICENSE
### Question 3
It is important to choose a license because otherwise, it has all rights reserved and therefore is not open source. Therefore, people will be unlikely to contribute, fork, or reuse the code. Giving a license allows you to set hard boundries on what you do or do not want to be done with your software.
### Question 4
Projects without an explicit license have all rights reserved. Therefore, access can be withdrawn at any point. Also, you may run into legal issues further down the road if you use code from a project without a license, as the creator of that project does own legal rights over that code.
### Question 5
I found the article interesing so I read the whole thing, and I do agree that not including other developers into Gopher's development led to Gopher's demise. That said, I don't think the impact of other things mentioned in the article should be understated. In particular, the article seemed to consider user's preference for Internet web browsers to be a small factor, but I think that was a significant key point. Many technical-minded people often lose sight of the fact that the majority of end users will prefer whatever is easiest to use, and Gopher was simply not as easy to use.
### Question 6
Microsoft's recent embrace of open source gives context to their decision to move the .NET Core to open source with the MIT license. Since MIT is very permissive, it seems Windows is hoping to gain more users of .NET. [Microsoft has overtime been slowly expanding into open source,](https://www.codemag.com/Article/2009041/When-Open-Source-Came-to-Microsoft) although it remains to be seen if they genuinely believe open source is the future or if Microsft is attempting their old strategy of "[embrace, expand, extinguish](https://www.justice.gov/atr/file/705216/download)".
